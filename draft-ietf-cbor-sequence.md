--- abstract


This document describes the Concise Binary Object Representation
(CBOR) Sequence format and associated media type
"application/cbor-seq".  A CBOR Sequence consists of any number of
encoded CBOR data items, simply concatenated in sequence.

Structured syntax suffixes for media types allow other media types to
build on them and make it explicit that they are built on an existing
media type as their foundation.  This specification defines and
registers "+cbor-seq" as a structured syntax suffix for CBOR
Sequences.

# Introduction

The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) {{-cbor}} can be used
for serialization of data in the JSON {{-json}} data model or in its own,
somewhat expanded data model.  When serializing a sequence of such
values, it is sometimes convenient to have a format where these
sequences can simply be concatenated to obtain a serialization of the
concatenated sequence of values, or to encode a sequence of values
that might grow at the end by just appending further CBOR data items.

This document describes the concept and format of "CBOR Sequences",
which are composed of zero or more encoded CBOR data items.  CBOR
Sequences can be consumed (and produced) incrementally without
requiring a streaming CBOR parser that is able to deliver
substructures of a data item incrementally (or a
streaming encoder able to encode from substructures incrementally).

This document defines and registers the "application/cbor-seq" media
type in the media type registry.  Media type structured syntax
suffixes {{-mediatype-reg}} were introduced as a way for a media type
to signal that it is based on another media type as its foundation.
CBOR {{-cbor}} defines the "+cbor" structured syntax suffix.  This
document defines and registers the "+cbor-seq" structured syntax
suffix in the "Structured Syntax Suffix Registry".

## Conventions Used in This Document

{::boilerplate bcp14}

In this specification, the term "byte" is used in its now-customary
sense as a synonym for "octet".

# CBOR Sequence Format

Formally, a CBOR Sequence is a sequence of bytes that is recursively
defined as either

* an empty (zero-length) sequence of bytes
* the sequence of bytes making up an encoded CBOR data item {{-cbor}},
  followed by a CBOR Sequence.

In short, concatenating zero or more encoded CBOR data items generates
a CBOR Sequence.

There is no end of sequence indicator.  (If one is desired,
CBOR-encoding an array of the CBOR data model values being encoded ---
employing either a definite or an indefinite length encoding --- as a
single CBOR data item may actually be the more appropriate
representation.)

This specification makes use of the fact that CBOR data items are
self-delimiting (there is no delimiter used between items, as there is
in JSON Text Sequences {{-jsq}}).

Decoding a CBOR Sequence works as follows:

* If the CBOR Sequence is an empty sequence of bytes, the result is an
  empty sequence of CBOR data model values.
* Otherwise, decode a single CBOR data item from the bytes of the CBOR
  sequence, and insert the resulting CBOR data model value at the
  start of the result of decoding the rest of the bytes as a CBOR
  sequence.  (A streaming decoder would therefore simply deliver a
  sequence of CBOR data model values, each of which as soon as the
  bytes making it up are available.)

This means that if any data item in the sequence is not well-formed,
it is not possible to reliably decode the rest of the sequence.  (An
implementation may be able to recover from some errors in a sequence
of bytes that is almost, but not entirely a well-formed encoded CBOR
data item.  Handling malformed data is outside the scope of this
specification.)

This also means that the CBOR Sequence format can reliably detect
truncation of the bytes making up the last CBOR data item in the
sequence, but not
entirely missing CBOR data items at the end.  A CBOR Sequence decoder
that is used for consuming streaming CBOR Sequence data may simply
pause for more data (e.g., by suspending and later resuming decoding)
in case a truncated final item is being received.


# The "+cbor-seq" Structured Syntax Suffix

The use case for the "+cbor-seq" structured syntax suffix is the same
as for "+cbor": It SHOULD be used by a media type when parsing the
bytes of the media type object as a CBOR Sequence leads to a
meaningful result that is at least sometimes not just a single CBOR
data item.  (Without the qualification at the end, this sentence is
trivially true for any +cbor media type, which of course should
continue to use the "+cbor" structured syntax suffix.)

Applications encountering a "+cbor-seq" media type can then either simply
use generic processing if all they need is a generic view of the CBOR
Sequence, or they can use generic CBOR Sequence tools for
initial parsing and then implement their own specific processing on
top of that generic parsing tool.

# Practical Considerations

## Specifying CBOR Sequences in CDDL

In CDDL {{-cddl}}, CBOR sequences are already supported as contents of
byte strings using the `.cborseq` control operator (Section 3.8.4 of
{{-cddl}}), by employing an array as the controller type:

~~~~ CDDL
my-embedded-cbor-seq = bytes .cborseq my-array
my-array = [* my-element]
my-element = my-foo / my-bar
~~~~

CDDL currently does not provide for unadorned CBOR sequences as a
top-level subject of a specification.  For now, the suggestion is to
use an array, as for the `.cborseq` control operator, for the
top-level rule and add English text that explains that the
specification is really about a CBOR sequence with the elements of the
array:

~~~~ CDDL
; This defines an array, the elements of which are to be used
; in a CBOR sequence:
my-sequence = [* my-element]
my-element = my-foo / my-bar
~~~~

(Future versions of CDDL may provide a notation for top-level CBOR
sequences, e.g. by using a group as the top-level rule in a CDDL
specification.)

## Optimizing CBOR Sequences for Skipping Elements

In certain applications, being able to efficiently skip an element
without the need for decoding its substructure, or efficiently fanning
out elements to multi-threaded decoding processes, is of the utmost
importance.  For these applications, byte strings
(which carry length information in bytes) containing embedded CBOR can
be used as the elements of a CBOR sequence:

~~~~ CDDL
; This defines an array of CBOR byte strings, the elements of which
; are to be used in a CBOR sequence:
my-sequence = [* my-element]
my-element = bytes .cbor my-element-structure
my-element-structure = my-foo / my-bar
~~~~

Within limits, this may also enable recovering from elements that
internally are not well-formed --- the limitation is that the sequence
of byte strings does need to be well-formed as such.

# Security Considerations

The security considerations of CBOR {{-cbor}} apply.  This format
provides no cryptographic integrity protection of any kind, but can be
combined with security specifications such as COSE {{-cose}} to do so.

As usual, decoders must operate on input that is assumed to be
untrusted.  This means that decoders must fail gracefully in the face
of malicious inputs.


# IANA Considerations

## CoAP Content-Format Registration

IANA is requested to assign a CoAP Content-Format ID for the media
type "application/cbor-seq", in the CoAP Content-Formats subregistry
of the core-parameter registry
{{-core-parameters}}, from the "Expert Review" (0-255)
range.  The assigned ID is shown in {{tbl-coap-content-formats}}.

| Media type           | Encoding | ID    | Reference |
| application/cbor-seq | -        | TBD63 | RFCthis   |
{: #tbl-coap-content-formats cols="l l" title="CoAP Content-Format ID"}

RFC editor: Please replace TBD63 by the number actually assigned and
delete this paragraph.

## Structured Syntax Suffix

Structured Syntax Suffixes are registered within the "Structured
Syntax Suffix Registry" maintained at {{-sss}}.  IANA is requested to
register the "+cbor-seq" structured syntax suffix in accordance with
{{RFC6838}}, as follows:

> Name: CBOR Sequence

> +suffix: +cbor-seq

> References: RFCthis

> Encoding considerations: binary

> Fragment identifier considerations: The syntax and semantics of
fragment identifiers specified for +cbor-seq SHOULD be as
specified for "application/cbor-seq".  (At publication of this
document, there is no fragment identification syntax defined for
"application/cbor-seq".)

>> The syntax and semantics for fragment identifiers for a
specific "xxx/yyy+cbor-seq" SHOULD be processed as follows:

>>> For cases defined in +cbor-seq, where the fragment
identifier resolves per the +cbor-seq rules, then process as
specified in +cbor-seq.

>>> For cases defined in +cbor-seq, where the fragment
identifier does not resolve per the +cbor-seq rules, then
process as specified in "xxx/yyy+cbor-seq".

>>> For cases not defined in +cbor-seq, then process as
specified in "xxx/yyy+cbor-seq".

This draft has mostly been generated from {{-jsq}} by Nico Williams
and {{-jsq1}} by Erik Wilde, which do a similar, but slightly more
complicated exercise for JSON {{-json}}.  Laurence Lundblade raised an
issue on the CBOR mailing list that pointed out the need for this
document.  Jim Schaad and John Mattsson provided helpful comments.
